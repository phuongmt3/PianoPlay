# PianoPlay
This is a game that let people become a pianonist without learning to play a piano :)))
It's made of my love for music (even though I know almost nothing about music and had to study music theory at the most beginning) and programming.
It's also my wish for so long, and my stucks along the way too (which is making a piano tiles game that can be played on computer).
I've tried to find some source code with that idea (i'd thought that it's kind of a popular idea, and there'll be multiple games like this), but it came nowhere. Everything I've found is so dissappointing in my view (only have tiles and play song along, without any interaction between animation and sound). So I have to do all by my own.
Hope you all enjoy that!!
